### Backgrounds

Why this survey?

- International concern related to the development of weapons with AI has been growing. In the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Organization (IJCAI) some 2,400 people and 160 companies from 90 countries signed an agreement not to develop weapons with AI. What about you?
- I think it is appropriate to assess the possibility that the community can take a more active role in this regard.
