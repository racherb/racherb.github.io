For some time I have worked on the development of **Secure Artificial Intelligence**. That has led me to think about fundamental problems of various kinds. Problems related to *programming*, *system design*, *machine learning*, *artificial intelligence*, *computer system security*, *social networks* and their *business models*.

Other topics (*not less important*) have been of obligatory reflection as the *human relations*, the feasibility for the consensus of a minimum *global ethics*, the *legal* aspects that underlie, the relations between the communities of *free software* and the current use of their creations, as well as the philosophy referring to the transforming trip from the *human* being towards the *posthuman* being.

However, it is imperative and urgent to design the bases that facilitate the establishment and development of **Secure Artificial Intelligence**. While it is true that this would not prevent *Malignant Artificial Intelligence* from taking place, it will be a key differentiating element in the approaching economy by allowing consumers to make informed decisions, allowing them to identify which with the products on the market is reliable and safe.

A Secure Artificial Intelligence will provide a unique value that will determine the commercial success of new products and services based on Artificial Intelligence while establishing a new frame of reference to improving relationships between humans and between humans and machines.

Certainly, I still do not have the absolute clarity of what Secure Artificial Intelligence means but it is very inspiring to be able to dedicate time to a topic that is recently being installed in the scientific, technological and popular culture.

Writing this blog forces me to give shape of the ideas that I have been developing for some time and I hope that the community is involved in some way.

Dear reader, if you have come this far I would like to welcome you to my Blog and leave you an open invitation to be an active part of some projects that will be published soon.
