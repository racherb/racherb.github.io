For some time I have been working on the development of a Secure Artificial Intelligence and that has led me to think about fundamental problems of various kinds. These problems are related to programming, system design, machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer system security, social networks and their business models.

Other topics not less important have been of obligatory reflection as they are the human relations, the feasibility for the consensus of a minimum global ethics, the legal aspects that underlie, the relations between the communities of free software and the current use of their creations, as well as the philosophy referring to the transforming trip from the human being towards the posthuman being.

However, the most immediate and urgent is to design the bases that facilitate the establishment and development of a Secure Artificial Intelligence.

While it is true that this would not prevent a Malignant Artificial Intelligence from taking place, it will be a key differentiating element in the approaching economy by allowing consumers to make informed decisions, allowing them to identify which of the products on the market is reliable.

Secure Artificial Intelligence will provide a unique value that will be determinant in the commercial success of new products and services based on Artificial Intelligence at the same time that it will establish a new frame of reference for the improvement of human relations.

Certainly, I still don't have the absolute clarity of what Secure Artificial Intelligence means, but it is very inspiring to be able to dedicate time to a topic that is just being installed in the scientific and popular culture.

Writing this blog forces me to give shape to the ideas that I have been developing for some time and I hope that the community is involved in some way.

Dear reader, if you have come this far I would like to welcome you to my Blog and leave you an open invitation to be an active part of some of the projects that will be published soon.
