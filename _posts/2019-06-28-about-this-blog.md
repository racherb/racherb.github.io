For some time I have been thinking about how to develop a Secure Artificial Intelligence and that has led me to think about fundamental problems of various kinds. These problems are related to programming, system design, machine learning, artificial intelligence, system security, current social networks and their business models. 

Other topics not less important have been of obligatory reflection as they are the human relations, the consensus of a global ethics, the legal aspects, the relations between the communities of free software and the implications that entails the trip from the human thing to the transhuman thing and the posthuman thing.

However, the most immediate and urgent challenge is to design the bases for the development of a Secure Artificial Intelligence. While it is true that this would not prevent the development of a malignant artificial intelligence, it will be a differentiating element in the approaching economy where consumers will be able to make informed decisions when it comes to identifying which of the market objects contains a Secure Artificial Intelligence. A unique value that will be determinant in the commercial success of new products and services based on Artificial Intelligence. 

Certainly, I still don't have the absolute clarity of what a Secure Artificial Intelligence means, but it is motivating to dedicate time to a topic that is just being installed in the scientific and popular culture. Writing this blog forces me to shape the ideas that I have been developing for some time and I hope that the community will join in this challenge.

Dear reader, if you have come this far I would like to welcome you to my blog and leave you an open invitation to be an active part of some of the projects that will be published soon.
