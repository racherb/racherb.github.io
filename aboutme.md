subtitle: Who am I? I still, and sometimes, ask myself that question

My name is Raciel Hern√°ndez, I'm a Chemical Engineer and I studied a master's degree in Chemical Process Analysis. I currently work for Axity as a Senior Consultant in IT Process Automation and in my spare time I co-create new products. Still wanting to change the world.

## Brief history

I am often asked how I got into programming and the IT world. While developing my experiments for the development of new sucrochemical products, for improved oil extraction, in the development of superplasticizing additives or developing modulating defoamers for the alcohol tolerance of yeasts, I discovered that computer simulation was a powerful option in the planning and statistical design of experiments. I then began to simulate production processes on a pilot scale and then on a semi-industrial scale. The power to make decisions based on such simulations led me to program my own algorithms. One thing led to another and the final conversion occurs when the Ministry of Higher Education funds me a project to extend the experience in the development of new products and services with a marketing approach. It was something like connecting the laboratory scientist in the real world. Today I am writing code in Haskell which is, in my view, the highest form of coding.
