## Why is this blog NOT being published under the terms of a Free Culture License?

I believe that the culture that has developed around the culture of free and open source software is not up to the times. While I share these principles 100%, I don't think it's a reasonable alternative for the future. We will discuss these issues in this blog.

At the moment I have adopted this restrictive form which will be replaced by a new licensing modality called SRU License, which is in the process of incubation.
